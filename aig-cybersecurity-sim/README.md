# AIG Cybersecurity Simulation – Forage

This project simulates the responsibilities of an analyst within AIG’s Cyber Defense Unit as part of a virtual experience program on [Forage](https://www.theforage.com/). The focus was on vulnerability management, incident communication, and scripting for ethical hacking.

## 🧪 Project Objectives

- Analyze active cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities based on CISA advisories
- Draft a professional advisory email to guide remediation efforts across technical teams
- Write Python code to simulate brute-force decryption of ransomware-encrypted files

## 🗂️ Included Files

- `crafted-advisory-email.pdf` – A professionally written advisory email explaining the vulnerability and guiding technical response teams
- `crafted-bruteforce-code.py` – A Python script to simulate ethical brute-force decryption as part of a ransomware response effort

## 🔧 Tools & Skills Used

- Vulnerability analysis using public threat intelligence (e.g., CISA alerts)
- Secure communication & advisory drafting
- Python scripting for ethical hacking scenarios
- Threat mitigation strategy development

## 🎯 Outcome

This simulation provided hands-on experience with threat advisory workflows and ethical hacking techniques. It strengthened my analytical thinking, communication skills, and ability to respond to emerging cybersecurity threats with both technical and strategic approaches.
