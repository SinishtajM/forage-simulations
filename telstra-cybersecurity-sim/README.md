# Telstra Cybersecurity Simulation – Forage

This project simulates real-world responsibilities within a Security Operations Center (SOC) at Telstra as part of a virtual experience program on [Forage](https://www.theforage.com/). The simulation covered SOC communication protocols, SIEM alert triage, firewall rule development, and post-incident analysis.

## 🧪 Project Objectives

- Analyze and triage suspicious activity alerts
- Draft internal emails for alerting and firewall rule implementation
- Develop and test a Python-based firewall handler
- Write a postmortem report detailing findings and mitigation strategies

## 🗂️ Included Files

- `crafted-alert-email.pdf` – SOC alert notification email summarizing suspicious activity
- `crafted-firewall-request-email.pdf` – Formal request to implement a firewall rule
- `crafted-postmortem-report.pdf` – Final report documenting incident response and security improvements
- `firewall-server.py` – Python firewall rule handler simulating block/allow logic for suspicious IPs
- `firewall-server-handler.txt` – Sample output from the firewall server
- `test-requests.py` – Python script to simulate network traffic and test firewall behavior
- `test-requester.txt` – Sample output from the test traffic generator

## 🔧 Tools & Skills Used

- Python scripting for defensive automation
- SOC communication and alert response workflows
- SIEM log triage and threat detection logic
- Technical documentation and post-incident reporting

## 🎯 Outcome

This simulation enhanced my understanding of SOC processes, network defense logic, and communication standards during a cybersecurity incident. I gained experience working with Python in a security context and practicing structured response procedures.
